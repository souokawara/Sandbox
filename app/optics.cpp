Library for Optics

## Pysics for Quantum Computation Simulator
#  Make the emulation of optical interference in 3D Euclide Space. 
#  Some glass like media should also be set as a class.
#  This library will be utilized in the quantum computer simulation.

## The Circuit Simulator for Quantum Computation
#  Define I/O on the system.
#  Define the gates to set on it.
